# Installation of flask

- we only have pip command for the installation of the flask project
- so therefore create a virtual environment first then
- install flask there

for venv :- 

run this command in the directory in which we want to install the virtual environment
- python3 -m venv .venv
- . .venv/bin/activate (for activating the virtual environment)
- deactivate karne ke liye, just the deactivate keyword

# Thing about the virtual environment

- virtual environments are created so that projects having different versions of python don't interfere with each other
- like if we do changes in python version then it may break the projects having different versions of python
